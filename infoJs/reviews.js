		review:
			'After many years of dog ownership I can honestly say Green Lawns is the best kennels I have ever used. Julie really cares for and understands her ‘charges’ and the kennels themselves are spotless. The dogs always settle quickly into their routine with regular exercise and expansive, safe fields to run in. Julie is happy to walk them individually or match up with suitable companions. From the moment of arrival in the car park mine never give me a backwards look - I wholeheartedly recommend',

		review:
			'For the last 4 years, our 2 Labradoodles have frequently been staying at Green Lawn Kennels.  Their first stay was when they were 6 months old!  Stays at Green Lawns are now referred to by the kids as ‘going to holiday camp’ because the dogs have such a great time and are very spoilt with walks, attention and treats.  Both dogs adore Julie and whine like crazy as we near the kennels as they can’t wait to see her! They are always welcomed with a run in a field and lots of attention. And we leave them knowing they are very happy and well cared for. We can’t recommend Julie and her kennels highly enough',

			'Our dogs have holidayed at Green Lawns for many years now and always arrive excited to be there, proving it is a happy place for dogs! Julie’s love of all dogs shines through and is so very evident when ours enthusiastically greet Julie on arrival.  She treats each of our three dogs as an individual and caters for their separate needs in ways that are unexpected.  In fact we have learned much from her and often adapt our ways in light of her observations e.g. our old fella Drum likes to have his food raised up and then he is more likely to eat it.  Julie takes the time to work out how to make each of Drum’s visits good ones and we are grateful that she cares for Drum in such an empathic way.  Her passion for all animals is quite clear and there is no one better I would put my trust in when we need our dogs in a safe and caring environment while we go away. Thank you Julie! 😊',

			"We have been using Green Lawn Kennels for the past nine years and wouldn't go anywhere else. Our two labradors absolutely adore Julie who always treats them with great love and affection. A true home from home for our dogs.",

		review: `We have been bringing our Cavalier King Charles spaniel to stay at Green Lawns Kennels since we moved to the area six years agp.I can highly recommend the care that Lola has received on her visits, she happily walks in without a backward glance and enjoys her holiday as much as we enjoy ours! She is now quite elderly and a little frail but we are completely confident leaving her at the Kennels as we know that Julie will take the utmost care of her.We highly recommend Green Lawns as an excellent home from home.`,

		review: `Our two dogs have been going to Julie for there holidays for a number of years. Our first dog Cooper is a teacup Yorkie and would stay with Nan when we went away but as Nan got older it became harder. I was really worried about Kennels for him because he had never been and he was now 6 years old and is very stubborn and very sensitive and can’t be let of his lead ever! I spoke to Julie over the phone and visited the Kennels and it felt a safe place to leave Cooper and we have not looked back he loves it, especially the walks around the field! 

		Two years ago we got Woody our Cavalier he has had digestion problems from day one and I was really worried Julie wouldn’t take him but she is amazing with him and looks after him like her own, we go away knowing our boys are well looked after and loved by Julie and would be lost without her.
		
		Thank-you Greenlawns you are amazing. 
		⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️`,

		review: `I first visited Green Lawns Kennels 12 years ago.  I had viewed several kennels locally and after being shown around the kennels by Julie decided to book my black Labrador in for his first stay.   Well 12 years later and I am still using Green Lawns Kennels.  My dogs have always been excited when they arrive and look fit, healthy and happy when I have picked them up.   It’s a good feeling leaving my dog at Green Lawns as I know that he will be cared for the way I would want him to be.  I have no hesitation in recommending Green Lawns.

		review: `We have been taking Teilo to Green Lawns Kennels for a number of years now. Teilo always loves being there and is clearly at ease there, never looking back as he is walked around the field by Julie straight after we drop him off. 

        There is never a problem with booking and there can be no doubt at all that it is professionally run with attention to detail and a practical approach.`,

		review: `I have been boarding my dogs past and present with Julie at Green Lawns Kennels for many years
        now, for almost as long as Green Lawns has been open.
        My dogs always love Julie and the boarding kennel experience, they can’t wait to get out of the car
        when we arrive. They know the routine and seem to settle immediately with happy and smiling
        faces! They don’t look back as soon as I leave them with Julie.
        Julie is absolutely fantastic with my dogs who are so important to me and she will always let me
        know how they are doing.
        I know my dogs couldn’t be in better care and it so good to have piece of mind and to know they are
        safe. I can thoroughly recommend Green Lawns Kennel. `,
